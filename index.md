### What do I do?

Hi, I'm Jean and I design and develop Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality experiences.
The two latests pieces I worked on at Small Studio in Paris are [Ayahuasca: Kosmik Journey](<https://youtu.be/tCN_jAewgM4>) and [7 Lives](<https://youtu.be/ABLZynERzJM>), two profound award winning narrative VR experiences.

My background is in virtual production, which I studied and put in practice on the field, developing custom software solution for on-set previz and setting it up on set.
